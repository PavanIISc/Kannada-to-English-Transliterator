# Kannada-to-English-Transliterator
The project work involves development of an Android application for a non-native person in Karnataka state. Of course this App also helps the people who are interested to know the transliterated verson of Kannada characters. Because of globalization, we expect large number of non-native people in south India, particularly in Bengaluru.This is an effort to provide an ease to non-Kannadigas to read Kannada language from different sources like sign boards, street boards, kannada news papers, kannada documents, Banners etc,. The project work involves two modules: one is Development of Kannada OCR and next is Transliteration to English. Kannada OCR works well with printed as well as hand painted Kannada text.The user has to capture the image containing text(Kannada) of interest. The recognized Kannada text is transliterated to English and it will be displayed on the mobile screen. Testing has been done separately for each module. The standard ICDAR 2003 dataset and 350 images captured from outdoor which includes Kannada signboards, newspapers etc., are used for testing. The results are satisfactory.
